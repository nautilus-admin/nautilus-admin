# Contributing to Nautilus Hide

The extension is licensed under the GPLv3, so you are free to use it, modify it
and improve it.

Here are some ways to contribute:

## Translating

The extension needs to be translated to more languages. You are welcome to
translate it to yours!

The translation template, in gettext format, is located in the `po` folder.
You can use [Poedit](https://poedit.net) to edit it. The `.po` file must be added to `po/LINGUAS`.

You can send the translation through a pull request or through
the [issue tracker](https://github.com/nautilus-hide/nautilus-hide/issues).

## Coding

You are welcome to fix bugs or add new features.
Find bugs that need to be fixed in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/nautilus-hide/nautilus-hide/issues).

If you add any translatable string to the extension, please run the
"./po/update_potfile.sh" script to update the translation template.
